# Embedded Love

[Intro]

i've seen a lot of pain in my life but i've found that appreciating the beauty in this pain is how I'm able to grow from it. follow me 

[verse]

hey, who's that kid you thought was from the hood

when actually, i just rap giving you that good

try to make it out of this, fly away from violence

soaring on my wings, pulling strings like a violin.

yeah they say he's nice, never slipping on the ice

and i've been eating away from home, missing out on rice

but it's ok. i don't trip cuz my moms is always with me

hold my fans that cop my cd, rhymes is always listening

your glow is always glistening cuz we got to be above

and if you're a little short on rent, i could spot you another dub

you know it's heaven sent, it's why i'm giving up my things

if you ain't got a ride to work, i'll be filling up your tank

don't gotta fuss about that baby, you know that this rap made me 

fresher than the rest of all these pimps and these macs lately

put it in the swish like threes in the lakers

if you stressing over paper, i got some tree and some papers

we can breathe in the vapor

get high and chop it up while my boy chops it up

and he cleans up my taper, please tell the haters

i went to college, paid my homage, now my mom is framing my degree, check the papers

but i'm still rapping, still making minimum wage 

and the aunties still saying not a bit of 'em's aged

but i guess that's just life, it's beautiful ain't it. 

cuz a little after 'Pac passed, it was a beautiful painting

and my childhood is like an irremovable staining

i guess sometimes we forget just how beautiful pain is.

and here's a letter to the girls that i previously dated

i still remember all the good times i seriously stated

so forget me or forget me not, watching all the petals drop

i am not a liar, i was not made in a petal shop

so maybe one day, i will find true love in a world that is fading right now

and maybe one day i will find true love in the girl that i'm dating right now

but only time will tell, till then i might as well

make all these songs that collectors buy and sell, boost my clientele

cuz i'm chasing my dreams, weaving through life while i'm lacing my seams

but as i walk another mile, somebody's friend is dying

and i used to make her smile before she started crying

and i used to only take a puff before i started flying

and there used to be love before my parents started fighting.

but it's ok. my head is up, that's an old day so let it rust

look forward and look for that feeling of embedded love

pain is all shredded up, we live once so live it up

drink beer, blow tree, ask her out and kiss it up

and make sure that money don't swallow you whole

cuz all that greed and that green won't follow you home

but my flow is bento, cuz this is my momento

and i know that god is listening so hold that note

and i'm banished.

[outro]

it's my illusions, my illusions, my illusions . . . of oasis

it's my illusions, my illusions . . . of oasis

yeah
